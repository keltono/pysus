# The Pysus Programming Language

This language is a work in progress, but as it gets further along, the intention is to have a multi-paradigm systems programming language.
Hopefully it will fall into some overlap between D/C++, rust, and maybe OCaml.

## TODOS:

#### A quick list of things to implement (in order of intent to implement)

* arrays
* strings
* imports
* basic runtime library
* structures / user defined types
* lambdas/closures
* first class functions
