# The Pysus Programming Language

This language is a work in progress, but as it gets further along, the intention is to have a multi-paradigm systems programming language.
Hopefully it will fall into some niche overlap between rust, C++, and maybe OCaml.

## TODOS:

#### A quick list of things to implement (in order of intent to implement)

* while loops ("for"s will come later, in theory will be pythonic, e.g. "for x in y")
* imports
* pointers (referencing and dereferencing)
* arrays
* strings
