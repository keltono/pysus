# The Pysus Programming Language

This language is a work in progress, but as it gets further along, the intention is to have a multi-paradigm systems programming language.
Hopefully it will fall into some niche overlap between rust, C++, and maybe OCaml.

## TODOS:

#### A quick list of things to implement (in order of intent to implement)

* additional binary assignment operators (\*=, +=, -=, \=, %=)
* arrays
* strings
* imports
